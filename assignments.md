# Lesson 1: In-Class Assignments

## Integrated Practice Sessions

These assignments are designed to be completed during the lesson as you learn each concept, rather than all at the end.

## Assignment 1: Variable Declaration Practice

### Objective
Practice declaring variables, understanding data types, and using console output in JavaScript.

### Instructions
1. Open your existing HTML file and add a new `<script>` section
2. Complete the following tasks in your JavaScript file:

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks in your JavaScript file:

1. **Declare variables for your personal information:**
   - Create variables for your first name, last name, age, student status, and favorite color
   - Use appropriate data types (string, number, boolean)

2. **Display your information using console.log:**
   - Create a section header "=== Personal Information ==="
   - Log each piece of information with descriptive labels

3. **Try reassigning variables:**
   - Reassign your first name and age to new values
   - Log the updated values with a header "After reassignment:"

4. **Experiment with const variables:**
   - Create a const variable for your birth year
   - Try to reassign it (this will cause an error - uncomment the line to see it)

5. **Explore different data types:**
   - Create variables for text, number, boolean, null, and undefined
   - Use console.log to display each value and its type using typeof
   - Include a header "=== Data Types ==="

### Expected Output
Your console should display:
- Personal information
- Reassigned values
- Data types for each variable
- An error message when trying to reassign a const variable

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All variables are properly declared
- [ ] Console output shows all information clearly
- [ ] You understand the difference between let and const
- [ ] You can identify different data types

## Assignment 2: Calculator Practice

### Objective
Practice using operators, comparisons, and template literals in JavaScript.

### Instructions
1. Add this code to your existing JavaScript file:

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks in your JavaScript file:

1. **Create variables for two numbers:**
   - Choose any two numbers (e.g., 15 and 7)

2. **Perform all basic arithmetic operations:**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
   - Use template literals to display the results
   - Include a header "=== Calculator Results ==="

3. **Try comparing the numbers using == vs ===:**
   - Compare using both == and === operators
   - Test greater than and less than comparisons
   - Include a header "=== Comparison Results ==="

4. **Create a template literal with the results:**
   - Create a summary string using template literals
   - Display the sum of your two numbers

### Expected Output
Your console should display:
- All arithmetic operations
- Comparison results
- Template literal output

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All arithmetic operations work correctly
- [ ] You understand the difference between `==` and `===`
- [ ] Template literals are properly formatted
- [ ] All output is clearly labeled

## Assignment 3: String Manipulation

### Objective
Practice string operations, template literals, and basic calculations in JavaScript.

### Instructions
1. Add this code to your existing JavaScript file:

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks in your JavaScript file:

1. **Create string variables and concatenation:**
   - Create variables for first name and last name
   - Concatenate them to create a full name
   - Display the full name and its length
   - Include a header "=== String Operations ==="

2. **Experiment with string methods:**
   - Create a message string (e.g., "Hello World")
   - Use toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), and substring() methods
   - Display original and modified versions
   - Include a header "=== String Methods ==="

3. **Use template literals for string formatting:**
   - Create variables for name, age, and city
   - Create a greeting using template literals
   - Create a multi-line string using template literals
   - Include a header "=== Template Literals ==="

4. **Calculate age from birth year:**
   - Create variables for birth year and current year
   - Calculate your age
   - Create a birthday message using template literals
   - Include a header "=== Age Calculation ==="

### Expected Output
Your console should display:
- String concatenation results
- Various string method outputs
- Template literal examples
- Age calculation and birthday message

### Success Criteria
- [ ] String concatenation works correctly
- [ ] String methods produce expected results
- [ ] Template literals are properly formatted
- [ ] Age calculation is accurate
- [ ] All output is clearly labeled and organized
