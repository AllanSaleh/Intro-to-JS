// In JavaScript we use camelCase for variable names and function definitions
let name1 = "Barney"; //String
let num = 19; // this is number

console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name1} and I am ${num} years old`); //String Template Literal
console.log("This is another line");

// Variable Declarations
let firstName = "Allan";
firstName = "Bob"; // Reassigning variable

const PI = 3.14; // Constant variable: a value that cannot be changed
// pi = 78;

var something = "This still works but should be avoided"; // 'var' is not recommended and can lead to unexpected behavior. Relic from ES% and should not be used in modern code

// Data Types =====================
let text = 'Hello World'; //String
let number = 42; // number
let anotherone = 3.14; // number
